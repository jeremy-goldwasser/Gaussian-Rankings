# Gaussian Rankings

This repository contains ```R``` scripts used to generate figures and results for Gaussian Rank Verification paper. 
- ```unequal_variances.R``` generates Figure 1.
- ```line_plot_12.R``` generates Figure 2a, and ```line_plot_13.R``` generates 2b.
- ```NHANES_application.R``` produces experimental results.

```testing_functions.R``` contains functions for the valid ranking procedures described in the paper:
- Verify the winner as the best (Theorem 1)
- Identify the highest- or lowest- ranking stable features (Procedure 1)
- Evaluate the stability of the top-*K* set (Procedure 2)
